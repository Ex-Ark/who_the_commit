# Who The Commit
Search who used What the Commit as a commit message

## How it works

It gets a [What the Commit](https://whatthecommit.com) random & funny commit name.

It uses Github's [Commit Search API](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#search-commits)
(somewhat of a beta version :  `application/vnd.github.cloak-preview`)

Commits infos are displayed with the associated used and repo.

That's all folks.

## Contribute

### Guidelines

Use [What the Commit](https://whatthecommit.com) messages as commit messages only.
Make it fun.
